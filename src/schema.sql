Probably VS 4c. A thinly protected, but overall not steep, slab route. The crack and parts of the route above were wet. Finished up Hidden Chimney, so crampon-scratched that the granite looked like marble, it doesn''t get a rock grade - maybe no-one''s done it on rock before. Had to climb the whole lot with a pack on because we didn''t fancy crossing the snow field again to pick them up; that was just too slippy. I think this is a first ascent. I''d just met my dog''s vet running along the top so I''m naming the route after him, the dog not the vet, even though he''s a good vet.',90792);
